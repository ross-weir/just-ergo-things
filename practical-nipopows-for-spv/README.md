# Practical application of NIPoPoWs for SPV on Ergo

In this article we will go over the steps involved to perform Simple Payment Verification (SPV) of a transaction utilizing Non-Interactive Proof of Proof of Work (NIPoPoWs) on the Ergo blockchain. This article is intended for developers who might be wanting to use SPV in their applications and provides a working example along with explanations of required steps.

I will provide links I found useful while learning about NIPoPoWs at the end if you want to do additional research.

### What is SPV? Why use it?

SPV is a way of confirming some transaction occurred on the blockchain without needing to download the entire blockchain.

Aside from SPV there are 2 main ways of checking the inclusion of a transaction:

1. Running a full node and verifying the blockchain ourself - very secure but not succinct, verifying the entire blockchain can be costly on network & storage resources.
2. Checking with an external indexer/explorer service - very succinct but not secure, we put all our trust in the 3rd party being an honest actor.

SPV aims to be succinct and secure providing a good balance between the alternatives mentioned previously.

### How do NIPoPoWs fit into the picture?

SPV depends on a field in the block header called `transactionRoot`, because of this, a precondition for performing SPV is verifying the block exists in the blockchain. This is where NIPoPoWs come in. Assuming at least 51% of the nodes on the network are honest we can use NIPoPoWs to verify a block with a particular id has been included in the blockchain without needing to download the entire chain. Like SPV, NIPoPoWs provide a succinct and secure way to verify a property of the blockchain, in this case, block id inclusion.

Traditionally on other blockchains like bitcoin, SPV clients would still need to download all block headers to verify transactions using a field similar to `transactionRoot`. NIPoPoWs enable ultra light SPV clients as we no longer need to synchronize all block headers.

> ðŸ’¬ `transactionRoot` is a Merkle Tree root containing the hashes of all transactions in the block. Merkle trees are a compact way to store a set of hashes and later check if a hash is included in the tree.

### What are we going to do?

To showcase the above we are going to use SPV (via NIPoPoWs) to check if transaction [`258ddfc09b94b8313bca724de44a0d74010cab26de379be845713cc129546b78`](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/258ddfc09b94b8313bca724de44a0d74010cab26de379be845713cc129546b78) in block with header id [`d1366f762e46b7885496aaab0c42ec2950b0422d48aec3b91f45d4d0cdeb41e5`](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/d1366f762e46b7885496aaab0c42ec2950b0422d48aec3b91f45d4d0cdeb41e5) has indeed been included in the blockchain. These values have been chosen at random for the purpose of this article.

The steps we will need to take are the following:

1. Gather NIPoPoWs from peer nodes
2. Determine the best proof (more on this later)
3. Fetch the full block header
4. Obtain a Merkle Proof for transaction in block
5. Verify the Merkle Proof thus verifying our transaction exists

### Lets get started

For this example we are going to be using nodejs/JavaScript so lets get the project setup by initializing an NPM project and installing dependencies:

```sh
mkdir spv-nipopow-example && cd spv-nipopow-example
npm init
npm i @ergoplatform/ergo-lib-wasm axios
touch index.js
```

And add some boilerplate code:

```js
const { default: axios } = require("axios");
const {
  NipopowVerifier,
  BlockId,
  MerkleProof,
  BlockHeader,
  NipopowProof,
} = require("@ergoplatform/ergo-lib-wasm");

// Ergo mainnet genesis block id, used to prove/verify nipopows
const GENESIS = BlockId.fromHex(
  "b0244dfc267baca974a4caee06120321562784303a8a688976ae56170e4d175b"
);
// Id of the transaction we are verifying
const TX_ID =
  "258ddfc09b94b8313bca724de44a0d74010cab26de379be845713cc129546b78";
// Id of the block that contains the transaction
const HEADER_ID = BlockId.fromHex(
  "d1366f762e46b7885496aaab0c42ec2950b0422d48aec3b91f45d4d0cdeb41e5"
);

const K_PARAM = 7;
const M_PARAM = 6;

async function main() {}

main();
```

**What are the `k` and `m`  parameters?**

`K_PARAM`: Length of the chain suffix. In other words, how many blocks need to be mined before a block is confirmed. The current implementation only supports checking for transactions in confirmed blocks, i.e those before the most recent `k` blocks.
`M_PARAM`: NIPoPoWs are probabilistic in nature, we can use this parameter to adjust how certain we want to be that a proof is correct and provided by an honest party. Setting this to a higher number increases proof size so there is a trade-off between succinct-ness and trustworthy-ness of proofs. Potential values for this parameter could be `5` - `15`, `5` could be a good value if you are wanting to protect against 10% adversarial mining power and `15` for 30%, for example. Settling on a number here might take some trial and error.

#### Gather NIPoPoW proofs from peer nodes

In a real application an SPV client will build up a list of full node peers to request NIPoPoWs from, this is out of scope for this article so instead we will use a list of known peers.

The more full node peers we use the higher the chance we will find at least 1 honest node but this will also lead to increased network load, applications will need to find a balance between these factors.

NIPoPoWs are currently provided by peers via REST API so lets write a function that will take a nodes REST API url and return a NiPoPoW:

```js
async function getNipopowFromNode(nodeUrl) {
  const { data } = await axios.get(
    `${nodeUrl}/nipopow/proof/${M_PARAM}/${K_PARAM}/${HEADER_ID.toHex()}`
  );

  // Temporary JSON replacer function until bug fix is released in upstream `sigma-rust`.
  // There's currently an issue with scientific notion numbers.
  const proofStr = JSON.stringify(data, (key, val) => {
    if (key === "d") {
      return BigInt(val).toString();
    }

    return val;
  });

  return NipopowProof.fromJSON(proofStr);
}
```

Now lets call this function on a bunch of peers to obtain some NiPoPoWs:

```js
async function main() {
  // gather a list of nipopows from peer full nodes
  // we will only use 2 nodes to keep the example simple, real applications would use a bigger list.
  const nipopows = await Promise.all([
    getNipopowFromNode("http://159.65.11.55:9053"),
    getNipopowFromNode("http://213.239.193.208:9053"),
  ]);
}
```

#### Determine the best proof

We will now process the proofs provided by the peer nodes and determine which proof is the best.

In simple terms, the "best proof" is determined by the verifier assigning a score to each proof based on the `m` parameter, due to the way proofs are produced and verified granted the majority of nodes on the network are honest, honest node proofs will achieve a higher score.

Lets create a verifier and process the proofs:

```js
// The verifier needs the genesis block id due to the way the underlying interlink data structure works
const nipopowVerifier = new NipopowVerifier(GENESIS);

// Process all the proofs
nipopows.forEach((proof) => nipopowVerifier.process(proof));
```

After processing our proofs we will confirm and validate the best proof:

```js
const bestProof = nipopowVerifier.bestProof;

if (!bestProof) {
    throw new Error("verifier couldn't determine the best proof!");
}

if (!bestProof.suffixHead.id.isEqual(HEADER_ID)) {
    throw new Error("invalid proof!");
}
```

#### Fetch the full block header

Currently we only have the header id, in order to check the transaction inclusion we need the full header for the `transactionRoot` field.

Using a node that **wasn't** used previously to retrieve NIPoPoWs we need to fetch the block header:

```js
const extraNodeUrl = "http://198.58.96.195:9053";

const { data: blockHeaderJSON } = await axios.get(
    `${extraNodeUrl}/blocks/${HEADER_ID.toHex()}/header`
);
```

#### Obtain a Merkle Proof for transaction in block

Now we will obtain a merkle proof from the node for the transaction existing in the block. We need request and verify a proof instead of checking the `transactionRoot` field directly as we can't be sure the node will send us a true & correct header.

```js
const { data: merkleProofJSON } = await axios.get(
    `${extraNodeUrl}/blocks/${HEADER_ID.toHex()}/proofFor/${TX_ID}`
);

if (!merkleProofJSON) {
    throw new Error(`failed to get merkle proof for TX ${TX_ID}`);
}
```

#### Verify the Merkle Proof

Finally we will verify the merkle proof is valid for our `transactionRoot`:

```js
const merkleProof = MerkleProof.fromJSON(JSON.stringify(merkleProofJSON));
const blockHeader = BlockHeader.fromJSON(JSON.stringify(blockHeaderJSON));

if (!merkleProof.isValid(blockHeader.txRoot)) {
    throw new Error("merkle proof was invalid!");
}
```

And that's it! We've verified that our transaction has been included in the blockchain using NiPoPoWs for SPV.
